# Face movement & recognition system

## _contractor: Aleksander Filipkowski_
## _principal: Michał Czerwiński_


| dossier version | date | description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Rework v0.0.1 | 06.12.2021 | Beginning rework, after I realized I did the wrong thing. |
This version of the project currently has the ERDs and ORGs of the older version. Functionality of what I was actually supposed to do will be redone.


## Abstract 
The project is made to recognize face movement and mimics.

## Data structure

| data | type |
| ------ | ------ |
| INPUT | Camera checking |
| OUTPUT | room reservation message and database entry |

## Main functionalities

1. Using the camera to find face movement (This is done without taking data - It's only local to a said device).
1. Working without fail (So no need for calibration is needed).

The above functionalities were tested and are working according to their roles.

> As a contractor on the project, I certify that the above functionality 
> does not compromise cyberspace or any other space of any state. 
> The code contained in the project, does not contain malware and is safe to use. 
> I am personally responsible for its operation: Aleksander Filipkowski.
